Projects

### AlternativeBot
The project that got me into coding!

General purpose Discord bot. The intent was to host it 24/7 eventually and compete with larger bots like Dyno and MEE6, but I ended up losing motivation to work on it.

### Islanders
Created as part of PyWeek 30, Islanders was a 1 week game jam project created by Maple Maelstrom, Amatol, Toastz, and I. Over 20 hours were put into this project just by myself, even though the end result was nowhere near any of the best projects made that week.

### NoSnipe Overlay
A lockdown project, NoSnipe Overlay was meant to be a rival to similar Hypixel stat checking overlays such as bwstats and Abyss Overlay. I was able to complete the base logic of the overlay and implement it in command line, but I lost motivation after the Hypixel DDoS and never completed the GUI for the overlay.

### Tournament Organiser Discord Bots
My current project, alongside competitive programming, is creating Discord bots to manage and organise Challonge tournaments through Discord. The bot is capable of creating channels to organise matches, register teams from a spreadsheet, and mark wins from within Discord.
